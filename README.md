# E-Learning Platform UI

This project is a simple front-end design for an e-learning course listing platform, inspired by Udemy. It includes a search bar, course listings, and filtering options.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for courses.
- **Course Listings**: Displays courses with images, titles, ratings, and prices.
- **Filters**: Users can filter courses based on ratings.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Basic interactivity (e.g., search bar input handling).

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the search bar to search for courses (functionality to be implemented).
3. Apply filters to sort courses based on ratings.

## Future Improvements
- Implement actual search functionality.
- Add filtering logic.
- Connect to a backend for real course data.

## Setup Instructions
No special setup is required. Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
